Your excellences UN Secretary-General,

尊敬的秘书长阁下，

President of the General Assembly,

大会主席阁下，

Executive Director of UN Women，

妇女署执行主任阁下，

and distinguished guests:

以及尊贵的来宾们：

Today, we are launching a campaign called HeForShe. 

今天我们发起了一项名为HeForShe的活动。

I am reaching out to you because we need your help. We want to end gender inequality and to do this, we need everyone involved.

我之所以在这里是因为我们需要你们的帮助。我们想要终止性别不平等，实现这个目标需要每个人的参与。

This is the first campaign of its kind in UN. We want to try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for change.And we don't just want to talk about it. We want to try and make sure that it's tangible.

这是联合国同类活动的首例。我们力图动员尽可能多的男人以及男孩参与。且我们不想仅仅开出空头支票，我们希望全力以赴并达成目标。

I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago. And the more I have spoken about feminism, the more I have realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop.

六个月以前，我被任命为联合国妇女署的亲善大使。但我越是提及女权主义，越是意识到争取女性权益往往和仇视男性混为一谈。我十分确定的是，这种认识必需得停止。

For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.

郑重声明，从定义上来说，女权主义是一种信念，相信男女应享有同等的权利和机会，也是政治、经济以及社会的性别平等理论。

I started questioning gender-based assumptions a long time ago. 
When I was eight, I was confused of being called "bossy" because I wanted to direct the plays that we would put on for our parents - but the boys were not.
When at fourteen, I started to be sexualized by the certain elements of the media.
When at fifteen, my girlfriends started dropping out of their beloved sports teams because they didn't want to appear "muscly".
When at eighteen, my male friends were unable to express their feelings.

很久以前，我开始质疑种种基于性别的预设。当我八岁时，我很困惑被斥为“专横”，只因我想编排献给家长们的演出——但男孩不会受到相同的指责。当我十四岁时，我开始被某些媒体塑造成性感的形象。当我十五岁时，我的女性朋友开始纷纷退出她们心爱的运动队，因为她们不想看起来肌肉发达。当我十八岁时，我的男性朋友无法自如地表达他们的情感。

I decided that I was a feminist, and it seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that "feminism" has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating and anti-men, unattractive, even. Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one?

那时我决定成为一个女权主义者，并且这对我来说是件简单明了的事。但我最近的研究表明，女权主义成为了一个不受欢迎的词汇。女性不愿意被认为是女权主义者。显然，我被列为措辞强硬、太过激进、自我封闭、反对男性，甚至没有魅力的那类女性。为什么女权主义变成一个如此令人不舒服的词？

I am form Britain, and I think it is right that I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women being involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life. I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly, I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights. No country in the world can yet say that they have achieved gender equality. These rights, I considered to be human rights.

我来自英国， 我认为我应该获得与男性同行相等的工资待遇。我认为我有权支配我自己的身体。我认为女性应该代表我参与到能影响我生活的政策制定中。我认为在社会上，我应该与男性享有同等的尊重。但很遗憾的是，我能说世上没有一个国家能使女性拥有这些权利。这世上没有一个国家现在敢断言他们实现了性别平等。这些权利，我认为就是人权。

But I am one of the lucky ones. My life is a sheer privilege, because my parents didn't love me less, because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn't assume that I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day. These influencers were the gender equality ambassadors that made who I am today. They may not know it, but they are the inadvertent feminists who are changing the world today. We need more of those. And if you still hate the word，it is not the word that is important. It's the idea and the ambition behind it. Because not all women have received the same rights that I have. In fact, statistically, very few have been.

但我是个幸运儿。我生活在优待中，因为我的父母不会因我生为女儿而少疼爱我。我的学校不会因为我是女孩而限制我。我的导师没有因我将来可能会生育而对我不予厚望。这些影响我的人就如推广性别平等的大使，他们使我成为了今天的我。他们可能不会知道，但他们是无意识的女权主义者，悄然改变着当今世界。我们需要更多这样的人。如果你仍讨厌女权主义这个词，那么词本身并不重要，重要的是这个词背后的理念和愿景。因为并非所有的女性都能享有和我同等的权利，实际上，从数据上看只有很少一部分女性拥有这样的权利。

In 1997, Hilary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women's rights. Sadly, many of the things she wanted to change are still true today. But what stood out for me the most was that less than 30% of the audiences were male. How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?

在1997年，希拉里克林顿在北京做了一个关于女性权利的著名演讲。遗憾的是，她想改变的很多事情在今天依旧如故。但我尤其留意到，当时只有少于30%的听众为男性。当世上只有一半人受到邀请，或被鼓励加入到谈话中，我们又如何奢望能改变这个世界？

Men, I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation！Gender equality is your issue too. Because to date, I have seen my father's role as a parent being valued less by society, despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother's. I've seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of men, or less of a man.

男同胞们，我借此机会向你们发出正式邀请！性别平等也是你们的议题。因为时至今日，我见证到作为家长，父亲的角色被社会所轻视，尽管孩童时代我需要父母给予同等的关照。我见证到青年男性遭受着遭受着心理疾病的折磨而无法寻求帮助，因为害怕这样看起来不够男人。

In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. I've seen men made fragile and insecure by the distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don't have the benefits of equality either.

实际上，在英国，自杀已经成为20至49岁男性的最大死亡原因，超过交通事故、癌症和冠心病。我目睹了男性因为成功男人这种偏狭的观念，而变得脆弱和缺乏安全感。男性同样没有享受平等的利益。

We don't often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes. But I can see that they are. And when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. If men don't have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won't feel compelled to be submissive. If men don't have to control, women won't have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong.

我们不常谈到男性同样遭到性别刻板印象的禁锢。但我能察觉他们确实如此，并且当他们自由时，女性的状况也自然而然会改变。如果男性不必为了被认同而表现出攻击性，女性就不用逼迫自己表现得顺从。如果男性没必要掌控一切，女性也没必要被掌控。不管男性还是女性，都可以放任自己敏感感性的一面。不管男性还是女性，都能无所忌惮地坚强起来。

It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by who we are, we can all be freer. And this is what HeForShe is about. It's about freedom.

到了我们该用更大的视野看待性别，而不是两套对立的规范的时候了。如果我们能不再通过消减异性的特征来定义自己，而开始根据本真的自我来定义自己，我们都将更自由。并且这才是HeForShe的意义所在。这关乎自由。

I want men to take up this mantle. So their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice, but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too. We claim those parts of themselves they abandoned. And in doing so be a more true and complete version of themselves.

我希望男同胞们能肩负起这个责任。这样他们的女儿、姐妹和母亲才能从偏见中逃离，但同时他们的儿子也有权利释放自己脆弱和更人性化的一面。我们珍视他们所抛弃的那一部分自我。我们这样做是为了他们能保留更加真实和完整的自我。

You might be thinking who is this Harry Potter girl, and what is she doing speaking in the UN. And that's a really good question. I've been asking myself the same thing. All I know is that I care about this problem and I want to make it better. And having seen what I've seen and given the chance, I feel it is my responsibility to say something.
 你们可能会问，这个《哈利波特》里的女孩是干嘛的，她怎么会来联合国演讲。这真是个好问题，我一直在问自己相同的问题。我所知道的是，我关心这个问题并且想改善现状。既然我亲眼见到了这样的状况，也获得了机会，我自觉有责任说些什么。

Statesman Edmund Burke said, "All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for good men and women to do nothing." In my nervousness for the speech, and in my moments of doubt, I've told myself firmly, "If not me, who? If not now, when?" If you have the similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you, I hope that those words will be helpful. Because the reality is that if we do nothing it will take 75 years or for me to be nearly a hundred before women can expect to be paid the same as men for the same work. 15.5 million girls would be married in the next 16 years as children. And at current rates, it won't be until 2086 before all rural African girls can have a secondary education.

政治家埃蒙德伯克曾说，“邪恶压制正义只需要善良的男男女女坐视不管袖手旁观。”在我为演讲忐忑时，在我怀疑自己时，我坚定地对自己说，“如果不是我，何人？如果不是现在，何时？”当你面临同样的机会时，如果你有和我一样的疑问，我希望这些话能帮得上忙。因为事实是，如果我们无所作为，那要等上75年，或对我来说将近100年，才能期待女性和男性同工同薪。接下来的16年里，将有1550万女童被嫁为人妇。按照目前的状况，要到2086年，才能让所有的非洲偏远地区女童接受中等教育。

If you believe in equality, you might be one of those inadvertent feminists that I spoke of earlier. And for this, I applaud you.We are struggling for a uniting world. But the good news is that we have a uniting movement. It is called HeForShe. I am inviting you to step forward to be seen and to ask yourself, “if not me, who; if not now, when.”

如果你怀有平等的信念，那你就有可能是我之前提及的那些无心插柳的女权主义者。为此，我为你鼓掌。我们仍在为团结世界而努力，好消息是我们已经有了一个团结一致的运动，叫HeForShe。我诚邀你们，挺身而出，扪心自问，“如果不是我，何人？如果不是现在，何时？”

Thank you very very much!

非常非常感谢大家！
